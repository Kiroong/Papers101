Constraints can be a minimum distance between samples, a maximum distance between an arbitrary point and the nearest sample, and a maximum deviation of a sample's capacity (area of Voronoi cell) from the mean capacity. All of these constraints are based on the topology emerging from Delaunay triangulation, and they can be combined for improved sampling quality and efficiency. In addition, our algorithm offers flexibility for trading-off between different targets, such as noise and aliasing. We present several applications of the proposed algorithm, including anti-aliasing, stippling, and non-obtuse remeshing. Our experimental results illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that our remeshing quality is superior to the current state-of-the-art approaches.", "keywords": ["image sampling", "mesh generation", "optimisation", "blue-noise sampling", "simple push-pull optimization algorithm", "spatial constraints", "improved sampling quality", "Voronoi cell", "Delaunay triangulation", "antialiasing", "stippling", "nonobtuse remeshing", "Optimization", "Harmonic analysis", "Radio frequency", "Clustering algorithms", "Density measurement", "Noise measurement", "Blue-noise sampling", "push-pull", "surface sampling", "remeshing", "stippling"], "referenced_by": ["10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864503", "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2837115", "10.1109/ICDSE47409.2019.8971801", "10.1109/CSCITA47329.2020.9137783"], "referencing": ["10.1109/5.3288", "10.1109/TIT.1982.1056489", "10.1109/TVCG.2012.94", "10.1109/TVCG.2007.70430", "10.1109/TVCG.2014.2330574", "10.1109/TVCG.2015.2505279", "10.1145/325334.325182", "10.1145/37401.37410", "10.1145/2766930", "10.1145/2487228.2487233", "10.1145/1141911.1141915", "10.1145/1278780.1278807", "10.1145/1360612.1360619", "10.1145/1640443.1640451", "10.1145/2010324.1964944", "10.1145/2516971.2516973", "10.1145/1576246.1531392", "10.1145/2018323.2018345", "10.1145/1964921.1964943", "10.1145/2366145.2366190", "10.1145/2816795.2818102", "10.1145/2980179.2982428", "10.1145/2185520.2185572", "10.1145/2366145.2366189", "10.1145/2601097.2601107", "10.1145/2816795.2818139", "10.1145/1559755.1559758", "10.1145/2461912.2461927", "10.1145/2010324.1964945", "10.1145/2630397.2630403", "10.1145/280814.280947", "10.1145/378456.378514", "10.1145/2766901", "10.1145/2508363.2508375", "10.1145/2980179.2980218", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01100.x", "10.1080/2151237X.2006.10129217", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03059.x", "10.1016/j.cag.2014.09.015", "10.1016/j.cag.2011.03.031", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01716.x", "10.1007/s11390-015-1535-0", "10.1111/cgf.12538", "10.1016/j.cad.2013.08.015", "10.1137/S0036144503429121", "10.1007/978-3-540-33265-7_2", "10.1016/j.cad.2011.08.012", "10.1007/s00371-014-0948-z", "10.1111/cgf.12981", "10.1016/j.cagd.2016.02.004", "10.1137/S0036144599352836", "10.1016/j.gmod.2004.06.007", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01521.x", "10.1016/j.cag.2015.11.002", "10.1111/cgf.12442", "10.1063/1.1289238", "10.1111/1467-8659.00236", "10.1016/S0013-7944(98)00069-1"]}, "10.1109/TVCG.2016.2637333": {"doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2016.2637333", "author": ["E.

This effort facilitates keeping artworks current and translating them to different forms for diverse audiences. Chinese ink paintings and Japanese Sumies are well recognized in Western cultures, yet not easily practiced due to the years of training required. We are motivated to develop an interactive system for artists, non-artists, Asians, and non-Asians to enjoy the unique style of Chinese paintings. In this paper, our focus is on replacing static water flow scenes with animations. We include flow patterns, surface ripples, and water wakes which are challenging not only artistically but also algorithmically. We develop a data-driven system that procedurally computes a flow field based on stroke properties extracted from the painting, and animate water flows artistically and stylishly. Technically, our system first extracts water-flow-portraying strokes using their locations, oscillation frequencies, brush patterns, and ink densities. We construct an initial flow pattern by analyzing stroke structures, ink dispersion densities, and placement densities. We cluster extracted strokes as stroke pattern groups to further convey the spirit of the original painting. Then, the system automatically computes a flow field according to the initial flow patterns, water boundaries, and flow obstacles. Finally, our system dynamically generates and animates extracted stroke pattern groups with the constructed field for controllable smoothness and temporal coherence. The users can interactively place the extracted stroke patterns through our adapted Poisson-based composition onto other paintings for water flow animation. In conclusion, our system can visually transform a static Chinese painting to an interactive walk-through with seamless and vivid stroke-based flow animations in its original dynamic spirits without flickering artifacts.", "keywords": ["art", "computer animation", "feature extraction", "flow simulation", "image motion analysis", "ink", "painting", "wakes", "NPR illustrations", "natural flows", "static paintings", "Chinese ink paintings", "interactive system", "static water flow scenes", "flow patterns", "water wakes", "data-driven system", "flow field", "stroke properties", "brush patterns", "ink densities", "ink dispersion densities", "stroke pattern groups", "water boundaries", "flow obstacles", "extracted stroke patterns", "water flow animation", "seamless stroke-based flow animations", "vivid stroke-based flow animations", "water-flow-portraying strokes", "stroke structures", "Painting", "Animation", "Ink", "Dispersion", "Navier-Stokes equations", "Smoothing methods", "NPR", "data-driven", "chinese ink painting", "tensor field smoothing", "naiver-stokes equations"], "referenced_by": ["10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904669", "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2866090"], "referencing": ["10.1109/TPAMI.2006.81", "10.1109/TVCG.2007.16", "10.1109/TVCG.2011.290", "10.1145/311535.311548", "10.1145/15886.15911", "10.1145/258734.258896", "10.1145/1073204.1073221", "10.1145/1809939.1809947", "10.1145/2461912.2461998", "10.1145/1073204.1073273", "10.1145/1015706.1015729", "10.1145/1268517.1268528", "10.1145/2487276.2487277", "10.1145/1138450.1138454", "10.1145/218380.218442", "10.1145/800186.810616", "10.1145/192161.192186", "10.1145/383259.383260", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.02062.x", "10.1002/cav.207", "10.1007/s11432-009-0035-7", "10.1016/S0146-664X(72)80017-0", "10.1111/1467-8659.00539", "10.1016/j.cag.2012.03.021", "10.1016/S0167-8396(03)00002-5"]}, "10.1109/TVCG.2016.2625786": {"doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2016.2625786", "author": ["J.

The typical goal consists in finding a mesh that is (1) geometrically faithful to the original geometry, (2) as coarse as possible to obtain a low-complexity representation and (3) free of bad elements that would hamper the desired application (e.g., the minimum interior angle is above an application-dependent threshold). Our algorithm is designed to address all three optimization goals simultaneously by targeting prescribed bounds on approximation error $\\delta$ , minimal interior angle $\\theta$ and maximum mesh complexity $N$ (number of vertices). The approximation error bound $\\delta$ is a hard constraint, while the other two criteria are modeled as optimization goals to guarantee feasibility. Our optimization framework applies carefully prioritized local operators in order to greedily search for the coarsest mesh with minimal interior angle above $\\theta$ and approximation error bounded by $\\delta$ . Fast runtime is enabled by a local approximation error estimation, while implicit feature preservation is obtained by specifically designed vertex relocation operators. Experiments show that for reasonable angle bounds ( $\\theta \\leq 35^\\circ$ ) our approach delivers high-quality meshes with implicitly preserved features (no tagging required) and better balances between geometric fidelity, mesh complexity and element quality than the state-of-the-art.", "keywords": ["Approximation error", "Complexity theory", "Surface reconstruction", "Approximation algorithms", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Electronic mail", "Error analysis", "Surface remeshing", "error-bounded", "feature preserving", "minimal angle improvement", "saliency function"], "referenced_by": ["10.1109/TVCG.2018.2837115", "10.1109/ICDSE47409.2019.8971801", "10.1109/CSCITA47329.2020.9137783", "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034075"], "referencing": ["10.1109/TVCG.2007.70430", "10.1109/TVCG.2014.2330574", "10.1109/TVCG.2015.2505279", "10.1109/TIT.1982.1056489", "10.1145/1015706.1015817", "10.1145/2766950", "10.1145/566654.566588", "10.1145/2516971.2516973", "10.1145/166117.166119", "10.1145/1057432.1057457", "10.1145/2366145.2366171", "10.1145/258734.258849", "10.1145/2508363.2508375", "10.1145/984952.984956", "10.1145/2816795.2818078", "10.1145/1531326.1531380", "10.1201/b10688", "10.1016/j.gmod.2004.06.007", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01521.x", "10.1137/S0036144599352836", "10.1115/1.1631021", "10.1111/cgf.12442", "10.1016/j.cma.2004.11.016", "10.1111/1467-8659.00532", "10.4208/nmtma.2010.32s.6", "10.1007/s00371-008-0259-3", "10.1090/S0002-9947-1959-0108673-9", "10.1111/1467-8659.00236"]}, "10.1109/TVCG.2017.2739159": {"doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2017.2739159", "author": ["Q.

Shape synthesis by reusing parts in existing models has been an active research topic in recent years.

We tackle this problem by introducing a human pose to describe object affordance which establishes a bridge between cross-class objects for composite design. Specifically, our approach first identifies groups of candidate shapes which provide affordances desired by an input human pose, and then recombines them as well-connected composite models. Users may control the design process by manipulating the input pose, or optionally specifying one or more desired categories.

Such approaches allow to explicitly and independently process shear rate, spin, and expansion rate. This can be used to, e.g., avoid interferences between pressure and viscosity solvers. Another interesting aspect is the possibility to explicitly process the vorticity, e.g., to preserve the vorticity. In this context, this paper proposes a novel variant of the prescribed-gradient idea that handles vorticity in a physically motivated way. In contrast to a less appropriate vorticity preservation that has been used in a previous approach, vorticity is diffused. The paper illustrates the utility of the vorticity diffusion. Therefore, comparisons of the proposed vorticity diffusion with vorticity preservation and additionally with vorticity damping are presented. The paper further discusses the relation between prescribed velocity gradients and prescribed velocity Laplacians which improves the intuition behind the prescribed-gradient method for highly viscous SPH fluids. Finally, the paper discusses the relation of the proposed method to a physically correct implicit viscosity formulation.", "keywords": ["damping", "gradient methods", "smoothed particle hydrodynamics", "viscosity", "vortices", "vorticity diffusion", "vorticity damping", "efficiently SPH fluids", "velocity gradients", "vorticity preservation", "velocity Laplacians", "shear rate", "high-viscous SPH fluids", "Viscosity", "Damping", "Laplace equations", "Acceleration", "Hydrodynamics", "Computational modeling", "Linear systems", "Velocity measurement", "Physically based modeling", "fluid simulation", "smoothed-particle hydrodynamics", "viscosity", "prescribed velocity gradients"], "referenced_by": [], "referencing": ["10.1109/TVCG.2013.105", "10.1145/1531326.1531346", "10.1145/2185520.2335413", "10.1145/2185520.2335412", "10.1145/2645703", "10.1145/2508363.2508395", "10.1145/2682630", "10.1145/311535.311548", "10.1145/545261.545289", "10.1145/1141911.1141960", "10.1145/2766925", "10.1145/1073204.1073282", "10.1145/2766982", "10.1145/2766996", "10.1145/1028523.1028549", "10.1145/2786784.2786798", "10.1145/2766981", "10.1145/566654.566586", "10.1146/annurev.aa.30.090192.002551", "10.1111/cgf.12324", "10.1016/0021-9991(89)90032-6", "10.1006/jcph.1997.5776", "10.1111/cgf.12578", "10.1063/1.868164", "10.1088/0034-4885/68/8/R01", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01832.x"]}, "10.1109/TVCG.2017.2756398": {"doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2017.2756398", "author": [""], "title": "2017 Reviewers List*", "year": "2017", "abstract": "Presets the reviewers who contributed to this publication in 2017.", "keywords": ["IEEE publishing"], "referenced_by": [], "referencing": []}}
